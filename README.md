## Notes for everyone else (that's you)
When you see the output you may see that it mentions a URL in the code. This is simply a link to an online compiler I have used due to complications with the C driver and such.
## Notes for me
so it seems like whenever i run a program it leaves a text file (so far I've only used c programs so I can't comment on anything else)

The asm_io.asm is the assembly code but the asm_io.inc is the macro code. I am not sure what macro code is.
